These are my solutions (in TypeScript) for the Advent Of Code 2022 - ref: https://adventofcode.com/2023

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
